# Design Notes

Architectural decisions and design rationale.

## Core Principles

1. **Standards Over Configuration** - Explicit contracts preferred over implicit system state
2. **Self-Hosting** - The builder node is both a product of and the platform that runs the factory
3. **Reproducibility** - Deterministic builds with traceable inputs
4. **No System Modification** - Build scripts do not attempt to install dependencies or modify host system

## Key Decisions

*To be documented as implementation progresses.*

# Bootstrap Flow

Multi-pass infrastructure bootstrap process.

## Overview

The infrastructure is built in stages, with each pass creating the foundation for the next:

1. **Pass 1: Identity & DNS** - Core services (identity, DNS, certificates)
2. **Pass 2: Compute** - Compute infrastructure (Proxmox nodes, Kubernetes)
3. **Pass 3: Services** - Application services built on compute layer

## Artifacts by Pass

*To be documented as implementation progresses.*
